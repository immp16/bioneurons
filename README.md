# Bioneurons
This repository contains the implementation for a biologically inspired neural network that integrates the quadratic integrate-and-fire formulation into the modern perceptron so as to enhance its capacity. In order to make the implementation more user-friendly, two Jupyter notebooks have been uploaded, each containing the same implementation, but addressing a different nonlinear problem. On the one hand, the XOR problem is solved employing this architecture. On the other hand, the concentric circumferences problem is solved employing the same architecture (with different hyperparameters, sure). For detailed information, please refer to the included report that contains all the details regarding the implementation and the theoretical background. Feel free to download and play with the notebooks!
